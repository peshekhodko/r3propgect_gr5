# First part: hypothesis test for the observed data

## 1.1. Read data
Read the data from txt file and save it in dataframe.

```{r}
data <- read.delim("mpg.txt", header=TRUE, sep=" ")
```


## 1.2. Two sample t-test

Conduct two sample t-test twice: with equal variance and with unequal veriance.
T-test with equal variance: 

```{r}
equal.var.test <- t.test( MPG~Country, data = data, var.equal=TRUE, conf.level=0.95)
equal.var.test
```

Based on the equal variance t.test **p-value=`r equal.var.test$p.value`** is small (less then 5% cut off), we can reject the null hypothesis. 

T-test with unequal variance: 

```{r}
unequal.var.test <- t.test( MPG~Country, data = data, var.equal=FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
unequal.var.test
```

Based on the unequal variance t.test **p-value=`r unequal.var.test$p.value`** is small (less then 5% cut off), we also can reject the null hypothesis. 

## 1.3. How well the normality assumption met by the data

To test data for normality we will use 3 methods:

- Compare histogram of the data to a normal probability curve for the data
- Quantile-quantile plot
- Goodness of fit

First, split up data in two data sets based on the country. 
```{r message=FALSE}
# Split up data based on the country name
us <- filter(data, Country == "US")
japan <- filter(data, Country == "Japan")
```

Plot histogram with overlaping normal curve and quantile-quantile plot for the US data.

```{r  message=FALSE}
# Plot histogram
hist_us<- ggplot (us, aes(MPG))+geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),colour="black", fill = "white") + 
  ggtitle("US") + stat_function(fun=dnorm, args = list (mean = mean(us$MPG), sd=sd(us$MPG)), 
                                  colour = "red")
# Plot quantile-quantile plot
qq_us <- ggplot(us, aes(sample = MPG))+stat_qq()+stat_qq_line()
# Arrange two plots in one grid
grid.arrange(hist_us, qq_us, ncol=1, nrow=2)
```

Plot histogram with overlaping normal curve and quantile-quantile plot for the Japan data.

```{r  message=FALSE}
# Plot histogram
hist_jpn <- ggplot (japan, aes(MPG))+geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),colour="black", fill = "white") + 
  ggtitle ("Japan") + stat_function(fun=dnorm, args = list (mean = mean(japan$MPG), sd=sd(japan$MPG)), 
                                    colour = "red")
# Plot quantile-quantile plot
qq_jpn <- ggplot(japan, aes(sample = MPG))+stat_qq()+stat_qq_line()
# Arrange two plots in one grid
grid.arrange(hist_jpn, qq_jpn, ncol=1, nrow=2)
```

Based on the graphical methods, data does not fit normality well.

Apply goodness of fit test to the data:

```{r}
# Goodness of fit test for us and japan data
gofTest(us, distribution = "norm")
gofTest(japan, distribution = "norm")
```

Small p-values for both data mean that we can reject the null hypothesis (H0 - the data is consistent with normal distribution) and both data sets 
are not consistent with Normal distribution.

## 1.4. Preferable test for selected dataset

Given that the data is violate the normality assumption, there are two options:
1. We can transform our data so that the data becomes normally ditributed
2. Run non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) that does not require the assumption of normality.
